Third Project :ATM Interface
==============================
In this I have Created a class ATMApplication to represent the ATM machine.
and designed the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
I have implemented the methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance().

Then I Created a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance with initial amount of $1000.0, then I Connected the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.
 In this user input will be validated to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g. sufficient balance for withdrawals) and
 Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.
 It includes following files(BankAccount.java, ATMApplication.java, logo.png, card.png, atm_bg.png)
